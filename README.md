# Work-tracker

Created a daily worker tracker to help with the day to day workload.
This work day tracker should help you organize your work load for the day per hour.  


## Creation

Creating the work tracker was a bit hard, but once creating each function for each aspect of the program. It kinda fell all into place. Starting with the variable for the current time then using I was capable to put the date onto the page. Next was creating a adevent listner for the save button then tethering local storage to the save button which will take the text values, which are inserted by the user.
Next was to add a function to color code the timeblocks to let the user know which tasks were still left for the day.
